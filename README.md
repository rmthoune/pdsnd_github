Explore US Bikeshare Data


The bikeshare.py program explores bikeshare data from 3 major US cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington.  The data ranges from January 2017 to June 2017.  The program requires the data to be filtered by city and can additionally be filtered by month or day of the week.  The program displays the most popular months, days, and time of the bikeshares, the most popular bikeshare stations, trip duration stats, an d demographic stats for the bikeshare users.  There is an option to view the filtered raw data after the statistics are displayed if you want to dig deeper into the data.  The data can be sorted by 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Trip Duration', 'Start Station', or 'End Station' for viewing.
